#### For me Big data is data that cannot be measured by human means and is also difficult to process by the existing computing systems the data are generated from unprecedented resources. There are 3 v of big data Velocity volume velocity and variety. We need to deal with The 3 views of big data volume, velocity, and, variety show big data columns in a large part of Google. For example, Amazon generates billions of terabytes of guitar every day and we need technology to process bad velocity which is another aspect of the data that will come in large quantities at a very fast speed we need to process it as soon as possible variety the data use of many different formats that were structured or on the structure so we need all of this different data types to be in one common format so that we can process it add to make a suitable pattern out of it. There are an additional 3 views of big data as well which are veracity value and variability Veracity is about the truthfulness of the data that is reported we need to make sure of that. Variability We need to make sure that the data that is inconsistent can you processed in big data, especially in social media data. The value we need proper data mining techniques to gain valuable insights from big data
